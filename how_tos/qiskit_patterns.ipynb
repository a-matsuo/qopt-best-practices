    "In Step 1. we will take a combinatorial optimization problem and formulate it in terms of finding the ground state of an Ising Hamiltonian. This reformulated prblem can be understood by a quantum computer. In Step 2. we will prepare the quantum circuits to execute on the quantum computer.\n",
    "In Step 3. we will call the `Sampler` primitive in Qiskit to draw samples from the quantum circuits that Step 2. prepared. Finally, under Step 4. we convert the samples from Step 3. into the solution of our combinatorial optimization problem. "

To be more concrete, we will consider a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem with the form\n",
