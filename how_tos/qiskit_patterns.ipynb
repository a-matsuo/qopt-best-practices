    "# Qiskit Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "In this how-to we will learn about Qiskit patterns and quantum approximate optimization. Qiskit Patterns are a workflow to execute a task on a Quantum computer. They comprise four steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Map the classical inputs to a quantum problem\n",
    "2. Optimize problem for quantum execution\n",
    "3. Execute using Qiskit Runtime primitives\n",
    "4. Post-process, return result in classical format\n",
    "\n",
    "In Step 1. we will take a combinatorial optimization problem and formulate it in terms of finding the ground state of an Ising Hamiltonian. This reformulated prblem can be understood by a quantum computer. In Step 2. we will prepare the quantum circuits to execute on the quantum computer.\n",
    "In Step 3. we will call the `Sampler` primitive in Qiskit to draw samples from the quantum circuits that Step 2. prepared. Finally, under Step 4. we convert the samples from Step 3. into the solution of our combinatorial optimization problem. "
